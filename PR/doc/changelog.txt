2) ToDo List
 i)   Code the compression algorithms (B0, B1, B2) to optimize the bitmap compiled dat files
 ii)  Add full pop2 support
 iii) Add resources tree in xml. See the sample resources.xml and folder.xml
parsing:

typedef struct tTag {
 short int id;
 tTag* child;
 tTag* next;
 char* field1;
 char* field2;
}tTag;

tTag* getTagStructure(); //initializes
freeTagStructure(tTag* structure)
int (0 if end) parseNext(char** pString, tTag* tag);


 iv)  Code the compression algorithms (B3, B4) to optimize the bitmap compiled dat files
 v)   Add a C++ class to use PR

3) Future Versions:
  PR v0.8 beta: added i,iii
  PR v0.9:      tested and stable
  PR v1.0:      First optimized & stable version for win32 and unix based systems
  PR v1.1:      added v
  PR v1.5:      added iv
  PR v2.0 beta: added ii
  PR v2.0:      Optimized & stable version for win32 and unix based systems
