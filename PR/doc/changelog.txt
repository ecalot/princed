1) Change Log
 * PG
  - Added support to export .bmp files
  - Added bitmap decompression
  - Added static palette extraction
 * PS
  - Added support to .mid files
  - Added support to indexed dat files
 * PR 0.1 Alpha
  - Merged PS and PG into one extractor.
  - Added dynamic palette extraction
  - Added resource.txt parser.
  - Added support to .wav files.
  - Added support to export JASC palette for .pal files.
  - Coded type header verification
  - Solved several bugs.
 * PR 0.2 Alpha
  - Added classifying dat type feature
  - Added support to import .bmp files
  - Implemented CGI output support for UNIX versions
  - Source files were abstracted
 * PR 0.3 beta
  - Added modifiers -x[rnu] -c[r]
  - Added pr.dll compiling
  - Bitmaps aren't upside down anymore 
  - Images bigger than 256 pixels length or width now are recognized
  - Improved decompression algorithm in bigger images
  - Optimized bitmap handling
  - Solved bugs in bitmap format
  - Solved segmentation fault in title.dat
 * PR 0.4 beta
  - Fixed a memory bug since v0.3
  - Pop2 DAT files detected (file type 11)
 * PR 0.5 beta
  - Abstracted format handling
  - Optimized bmp saving algorithm
  - Solved and optimized decompression for big images
  - Some Pop2 graphics are extracted (palettes aren't supported yet)
 * PR 0.6 alpha
  - Coded full import/export bmp (in separate files not included in this distribution)
  - Completed and tested bmp reading algorithm
  - Optimized PG algorithms and reserved memory sizes
 * PR 0.6 beta
  - Added full import bmp support
  - Solved palette import bug
 * PR 0.7
  - Added Makefile
  - Moved PG module to compress.c and bmp.c
  - Moved midi support to mid.c
  - Solved corrupted images on compression bug
  - Source ported to several compilers and platforms
 * PR 0.8 beta
  - Abstracted disk functions into one module
  - Added PC Speaker sound classification
  - Added compression algorithms B0 and B2. Before that it was only working B1.
  - Coded a base directory creator for files
  - Coded a parser and the resources tree in xml. 
  - Coded inheritance of owner's attributes to tag child
  - Coded linking from an id to a palette
  - Coded the compression algorithm selector to optimize the bitmap compiled dat files
  - Coded unknown extracted files saved in unknown.xml
 * PR v0.9
  - Abstracted output
  - Coded detector of dat file in relative path (e.g. pr dat/dungeon.dat -x l)
  - Dropped old code (txt parser and directory parsing functions)
  x Improved B1/B2 compressor
  x Improved resources.xml
  x Tested and stable
  x Works in all dat files
  x Set, if applicable, POP2 in the father folder of the unknown.xml file
  x Code full extractor (looks for all files in a speficied tag and children 
    and makes a list calling to addIfNotRepeated, then calls PR extract
    fucntion for each file in the list)
  - Defined and supported .plv format for RoomShaker & Princed. 
  - Added pr.so dynamic library for unix versions
  - Coded new UNIX-style command line parsing and options

2) ToDo List
 i)   Add full pop2 support
 ii)  Code the compression algorithms (B3, B4) to optimize the bitmap compiled dat files
 iii) Add a C++ class to use PR


3) Future Versions:
  PR v1.0:      First optimized & stable version for win32 and unix based systems
  PR v1.1:      added iii
  PR v1.5:      added ii
  PR v2.0 beta: added i
  PR v2.0:      Optimized & stable version for win32 and unix based systems
