Format of .def files:

[FILE]
[TYPE]
[number 1]
[number 2]
[number 3]
...

Where FILE is the dat file where the resource is and type is the
resource type according to "type" program.

use:
 - ./type [ACTION]
  where ACTION is
	 - list: to see a list of valid .def file types
	 - add: to add a new type
	 - del: to remove a type
	 - ren: to rename a type (not tested)
 - ./makedat
  to compile all .def resources in def file

Both scripts will save the output files in the result directory.
There are symbolic links from the places where those files are
needed. This means that every time you run a makedat, the binary
version of freeprince has their resources updated too.

Note: a new build compilation is needed because the .h files are
different now. Use "make build" in the freeprince src directory.
