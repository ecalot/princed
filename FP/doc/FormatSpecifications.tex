1. Preamble
 This file was written thanks to the reverse engineering made by several
 people, see the credits section.

2. Introduction
 There are two versions of the DAT file format: DAT v1.0 used in POP 1.x
 and DAT v2.0 used in POP 2. In this document we will specify DAT v1.0.

 DAT files were made to store levels, images, palettes, wave, midi and
 internal speaker sounds. Each type has it's own format as described in
 the next sections.
 
 As the format is very old and the original game was distributed in disks,
 it is normal to think that the file format uses checksum validation to
 detect any kind of file corruption.

 DAT files are indexed, this means there is an index and you can access
 each resource through an ID and this ID is unique for the resource inside
 the file.

 Images stores their height and width but not their palette, so the palette
 is another resource and must be shared by a group of images.

3. Primitives
 This section shows how the PR dat handling primitives works, this library
 is useful to access resources without having to worry about the format.

3.1. DAT reading and writing primitives
 Opening a dat file for RW mode
 Syntax:
 int mRWBeginDatFile(
  const char* vFile, /* the name of the file to be open */
  unsigned short int *numberOfItems, /* saves the total items count */
  int optionflag /* see optionflag appendix */
 );
 Return values are:

 int mRWCloseDatFile(dontSave)

3.2. DAT reading primitives
 int  mReadBeginDatFile(unsigned short int *numberOfItems,const char* vFile);
 int  mReadFileInDatFile(int indexNumber,unsigned char** data,unsigned long int
*size);
 int  mReadInitResource(tResource** res,const unsigned char* data,long size);
 void mReadCloseDatFile();

3.3. DAT writing primitives
 int  mWriteBeginDatFile(const char* vFile, int optionflag);
 void mWriteFileInDatFile(const unsigned char* data, int size);
 void mWriteFileInDatFileIgnoreChecksum(unsigned char* data,int size);
 void mWriteInitResource(tResource** res);
 void mWriteCloseDatFile(tResource* r[],int dontSave,int optionflag, const char*
backupExtension);

4. File Specifications

4.1. General file specs, index and checksums
 All DAT files has an index, this index has a number of items count and
 a list of items.
 The index is stored at the very end of the file.
 The first 6 bytes are reserved to locate the index and know the file size.

 Stored values:
 Lets define the numbers as:
  LE - Little endian: 16 bits, storing two groups of 8 bits ordered from
       the less representative to the most representative without sign.
       i.e. 65534 is FFFE in hex and is stored FE FF (1111 1110 1111 1111)
       Range: 0 to 65535
       2 bytes
  BE - Big endian: 32 bits, storing four groups of 8 bits each ordered from
       the less representative to the most representative without sign.
       i.e. 65538 is 00010002 in hex and is stored 02 00 01 00
       (0000 0010 0000 0000 0000 0001 0000 0000)
       Range: 0 to 2^32-1
       4 bytes
  SC - Signed char: 8 bits, the first for the sign and the 7 last for the
       number. If the first bit is a 0, then the number is positive, if not
       the number is negative, in that case invert all bits and add 1 to
       get the positive number.
       i.e. -1 is FF (1111 1111), 1 is 01 (0000 0001)
       Range: -128 to 127
       1 byte
  UC - Unsigned char: 8 bits that represent the number.
       i.e. 32 is 20 (0010 0000)
       Range: 0 to 255
       1 byte

 Index structures:
 The DAT header: 6 bytes
  Offset 0, size 4, type BE: Index offset (the location where the offset
                             begins)
  Offset 4, size 2, type LE: IndexSize (the number of bytes the index has)
                             Note that the index size is 8*numberOfItems+2

 The DAT index header: 2 bytes
  Offset IndexSize, size 2, type LE: NumberOfItems (resources count)
  Offset IndexSize+2, size 8*NumberOfItems: The index (a list of
                              NumberOfItems blocks of 8-bytes-index record)

 The 8-bytes-index record: 8 bytes
  Relative offset 0, size 2, type LE: Item ID
  Relative offset 2, size 4, type BE: Resource start absolute offset
  Relative offset 6, size 2, type LE: Size of the item (not including
                                      checksums)

 Checksum byte:
 There is a checksum byte for each item (resource), this is the first byte
 of the item, the rest of the bytes are the item data. The item type is not
 stores and may only be determined by reading the data and applying some
 filters, this method may fail.

 The if you add whole item data including checksum and take the less
 representative byte you will get the sum of the file. This sum must be FF
 in hex (255 in UC or -1 in SC). If the sum is not FF, then adjust the
 checksum in order to set this value to the sum. The best way to do that is
 adding all the bytes in the item (excluding the checksum) and inverting
 all the bits.

 From now on the specification are special for each data (that doesn't
 include the checksum byte)

4.2. Images
 Each image has a 6 bytes header that is

4.2.1 Headers
 The 6-bytes-image header: 6 bytes
  Relative offset 0, size 2, type LE: Height
  Relative offset 2, size 2, type BE: Width 
  Relative offset 4, size 2: Information

 Information is a set of bits where:
  the first 8 are zeros
  the next 4 are the resolution:
   if it is 1011 (B in hex) then the image has 16 colors
   if it is 0000 (0 in hex) then the image has 2 colors
   so to calculate the bits per pixel there are in the image, just take the
   last 2 bits and add 1 (11 is 4 and 00 is 1).
  the last 4 are the 5 compression types:
   from 0 to 4:
   0 RAW_LR
   1 RLE_LR
   2 RLE_UD
   3 LZG_LR
   4 LZG_UD

 The next data is the image compressed with the specified algorithm.

4.2.2 Algorithms
 RAW_LR means that the data wasn't compressed, it is used for small images
        the format is saved from left to right (LR) serializing a line to
        the next integer byte if necessary. In case the image was 16 colors
	two pixels per byte (4bpp) will be used, in case the image was 2
	colors, 8 pixels per byte (1bpp) will be used.
 RLE_LR has a Run length encoding (RLE) algorithm, after uncompressed the
        image can be read as a RAW_LR.
 RLE_UD is the same as RLE_LR except that after uncompressed the image must
        be drawn from up to down and then from left to right.
 LZG_LR has any kind of variant of the LZ77 algorithm (the sliding windows
        algorithm), here we named it LZG in honor of Lance Groody, the
        original coder.
        After uncompressed it may be handled as RAW_LR
 LZG_UD Uses LZG compression but is drawn from top to bottom as RLE_UD

4.2.2.1 Run length encoding (RLE)
 The first byte is allways a control byte, the format is SC. If the control
 byte is negative, then the next byte must be repeated n times as the bit
 inverted control byte says, after the next byte another control byte is
 stored.
 If the control byte is positive or zero just copy textual the next n bytes
 where n is the control byte plus one and the next byte is another control
 byte.
 If you reach a control byte but the image size is passed, then you have
 completed the image.

4.2.2.2 Custom LZ
 Use the source, Luke.
 
4.3. Palettes
 Palettes have 100 bytes allways, after 4 bytes from the beginning the
 first 16 records of 3 bytes are the VGA colors stored in the RGB-18 bits
 format (6 bits for each color). Each color is a number from 0 to 63.
 Remember to shift the color bytes by two to get the color number from 0
 to 256.
 
4.4. Levels
 This table has a summary of the blocks to be used in this section,
 you can referr it from the text below.

 Length Offset  Block Name
 ~~~~~~ ~~~~~~  ~~~~~~~~~~
 720    0       wall
 720    720     background
 256    1440    door I
 256    1696    door II
 96     1952    links
 64     2048    unknown I
 3      2112    start_position
 3      2115    unknown III
 1      2116    unknown IV
 24     2119    guard_location
 24     2143    guard_direction
 24     2167    unknown II
 24     2191    unknown II
 24     2215    guard_skill
 24     2239    unknown II
 24     2263    guard_color
 16     2287    unknown II
 2      2303    0F 09 (2319)

 All leves has a size of 2305, except in the original game, that the potion
 level has a size of 2304 (may be it was wrong trimmed).

4.4.1 Unknown blocks
 Blocks described in this section are: Unknown from I to IV.

 Unknown III and II blocks doesn't affect the level if changed, if you find
 out what they are used to we will welcome your specification text.

 Unknown I may corrupt the level if edited.

 We belive unknown IV has something to do with the start position, but we
 don't know about it.

 As unknown III were all zeros for each level in the original set, it was a
 team decision to use those bytes for format extension. If one of them is
 not the default 00 00 00 hex then the level was extended by the team. Those
 extensions are only supported by RoomShaker at this  moment. To see how
 those extensions were defined read the appendix I'll write some day.
 
4.4.2 Room mapping
 This section explains how the main walls and objects are stored. The
 blocks involved here are "wall" and "background"

 In a level you can store a maximum of 24 screens (also called rooms) of 30
 tiles each, having three stages of 10 tiles each. Screens are numered from
 1 to 24 (not 0 to 23) because the 0 was reserved special cases.

 The wall and background blocks have 24 sub-blocks inside. Those sub-blocks
 has a size of 30 bytes each and has a screen associated. So, for example,
 the sub-block staring in 0 corresponds to the screen 1 and the sub-block
 starting in 690 corresponds to the screen 24. 
 It is reserved 1 byte from the wall block and one from the background block
 for each tile. To locate the appropiate tile you have to do the following
 calculation: tile=(screen-1)*30+tileOffset where tileOffset is a number
 from 0 to 29 that means a tile from 0 to 9 if in the upper stage, from
 10 to 19 if in the middle stage and 20 to 29 if in the bottom stage.
 We define this as the location format and will be used also in the start
 position.
 Allways looking from the left to the right.
 So there is a wall and background byte for each tile in the level and this
 is stored this way.

 The wall part of the tile stores the main tile form according to the table
 below. Note that those are just a limited number of tiles, each code has a
 tile in the game. The tiles listed are all the ones needed to make a level
 so the missing tiles have an equivalent in this list.

 The background part of the tile stores a modification or attribute of the
 wall part of the tile depending on what group it belongs. Those are not
 all the modifications in the game, there are more carpet styles, etc.

 (**) Spikes (5):
 The initial spike state is stored. Only type 0 allows the spike animation.

 Upper door slot (4):
 The type of the carpet is stored in the palace enviornment.

4.4.3 Room linking
 This section describes the links block.

 Each screen is linked to another by each of the four sides. Each link
 is stored. There is no screen mapping, just screen linking.

 The links block has 24 sub-blocks of 4 bytes each. All those sub-blocks
 has its own correspondance with a screen (the block starting at 0 is
 related to the screen 1 and the block starting at with 92 is related to
 screen 24).
 Each block of 4 bytes stores the links this screen links to reserving one
 byte per each side in the order left (0), right (1), up (2), down (3).
 The number 0 is used when there is no screen there.
 Cross links should be made to allow the kid passing from a screen to
 another and then comming back to the same screen but it's not a must.

4.4.4 Guard handling
 This section specifies the blocks: guard_location, guard_direction,
 guard_skill and guard_color.

 Each guard section has 24 bytes, each byte of them corresponds to a screen
 so byte 0 is related to screen 1 and byte 13 is related to screen 24.
 This screen is where the guard is located. The format only allows one
 guard per screen. Each block describes a part of the guard.

 The guard_location part of a guard describes where in the screen the guard
 is located, this is a number from 0 to 29 if the guard is in the screen or
 30 if there is no guard in this screen. Other values are allowed but are
 equivalent to 30. The number from 0 to 29 is in the location format
 specified in section 4.4.2
 
 The guard_direction part describes where the guard looks at. If the value
 is 0, then the guard looks to the right, if the value is the hex FF (-1 or
 255) then he looks left. This is the direction format, and will be used in
 the start position too.

 The guard_skill is how the guard fights, style and lives. Note that the
 lives also depends on the level you are. Allowed numbers are from 0 to 7.

 TODO: add a skill table

 The guard_color is the palette the guard has (see 4.8).

4.4.5 Starting Position
 This section describes the start_position block.
 
 This block stores where and how the kid starts in the level. Note that all
 level doors that are on the starting screen will be closed in the moment
 the level starts.
 
 This block has 3 bytes.
 The first byte is the screen, allowed values are from 1 to 24.
 The second byte is the location, see the section 4.4.2 for the location
 format specifications.
 The third byte is the direction, see 4.4.4 for the direction format
 specifications.

4.4.6 Door events 
 This section explains how the doors are handled and speficies the blocks
 door I and II.

 First of all he have to define what an event line is in this file. An event
 line is a link to a door that will be activated. If the event was triggered
 with the action close, then the event will close the door, if the action
 was open then the event will open the door. An event line has also a flag
 to trigger the next event line or not.
 An event is defined as a list of event lines, from the first to the last.
 The last must have the trigger-next-event-line flag off. This is like a
 list of doors that performs an action.
 An event performs the action that it was called to do: open those doors or
 close them. This action is defined by the type of tile pressed.
 Each event line has an ID from 0 to 255. An event has the ID of the first
 event line in it.

 In section 4.4.2 it is explined how a door trigger is associated to an
 event ID. Those are the tiles that starts the event depending on what are
 them: closers or openers.

 How events are stored:
 Each door block has 256 bytes, one per event line. Each event line is
 located in an offset that is the event line ID, so event line 30 is
 located in the byte 30 of each block.
 There is a door I part of an event line and a door II part of it. We'll
 define them as byte I and byte II.
 You can find there: the door screen, the door location, and the
 trigger-next flag. The format is the following:
 
 Let's define:
  Screen as S and it is a number from 1 to 24 (5 bits)
	 S = s1 s2 s3 s4 s5 where sn is the bit n of the binary representation of S
	Location as L and is a number from 0 to 29 (5 bits)
	 L = l1 l2 l3 l4 l5 where ln is the bit n of the binary representation of L
	 This number is according to the location format specifications.
	Trigger-next as T and is a 0 or 1 (1 bit)
   T = t1

 Byte I  has the form: t1 s4 s5 l1 l2 l3 l4 l5
 Byte II has the form: s1 s2 s3  0  0  0  0  0

4.5. Digital Waves
Just raw sound
 Size of Format: 16
 Format: PCM
 Attributes: 8 bit, mono, unsigned
 Channels: 1
 Sample rate: 11025
 Bytes/Sec: 11025
 Block Align: 1
 
4.6. Midi music
 Standard midi files

4.7. Internal PC Speaker
 We are not so sure about it, but we think it is:
  2 unique bytes for headers
  3 bytes per note (2 for frequency and 1 for duration)
 
4.8. Binary files
 Some binary files contains relevant information
 The resource number ??? in prince.dat has the VGA guard palettes in it
 saving n records of a 16-color-palette of 3 bytes in the specified palette
 format.
