To install from the CVS (advanced users only):
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If you are a coder type:

export CVS_RSH=ssh
cvs -z3 -d:ext:(USER)@cvs.fp.princed.com.ar:/cvsroot/freeprince co FP

If you aren't just type:

cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.fp.princed.com.ar:/cvsroot/freeprince co FP

When the download is finished, you'll get the whole repository.
To make the game for the first time type:

cd FP/src
make install

The dat files will be downloaded (about 200kb), after that the
configuration will be processed and the source compiled.

The CVS code isn't a binary distribution and it needs to be compiled,
some packets are required in both cases (coders and anonymous).

Minimum requiered packages needed for a succesful source build:
 awk gcc make libsdl1.2-dev

Packages needed if you want to do a "make install"
 wget tar bzip2

Recomended packages
 gqview bash vim cvs mawk/gawk dosbox
 
For the moment the only supported platform is x86. This is because of the
endian registers in the processors. We are working to finish the porting of our
abstraction disk library.
Installation (make install) is not needed if you want to build the sources,
but will download the data files needed by the game to be ran.

If you are using debian you can install the packages just typing:
apt-get install wget gcc make libsdl1.2-dev bzip2 tar

Make options:
- make            compiles only the latest modified sources
- make build      compiles all the sources
- make install    downloads dat files and compiles the game
- make checks     checks for the programs needed to perform a right compilation
- make clean      deletes all the files that are generated by make
                  except the ones that have been downloaded.
                  Note that this is not dangerous at all because make build
                  will regenerate them.
- make download   downloads the dat files, generate index
- make headers    parses the configuration files and builds the headers.
                  This uses all the awk stuff and is very useful to make a
                  package for other machines without awk installed (e.g.
                  machines running Windows systems).
- make it         does all the necesary stuff to run the game and runs it
- make run        runs a compiled game

CVS nightly tarballs:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Is just the last CVS stuff compressed. To install it just uncompress it and
follow the CVS installation steps (except for the cvs command).

To install from the binary distribution files:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
There isn't any distribution yet :(

Note:
~~~~
The program is very unestable, don't expect to see the original game, because we
need a lot of time more to reach something similar. Please be patient. Current
CVS distributions are just for developers or to show the improvements.
