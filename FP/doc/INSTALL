To install from the CVS (advanced users only):
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If you are a coder type:

export CVS_RSH=ssh
cvs -z3 -d:ext:(USER)@cvs.fp.princed.com.ar:/cvsroot/freeprince co FP

If you aren't just type:

cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.fp.princed.com.ar:/cvsroot/freeprince co FP

When the download is finished, you'll get the whole repository.
To make the game for the first time type:

cd FP/src
make install

The dat files will be downloaded (about 200kb), after that the resource
index will be generated and the source compiled.

The the CVS code isn't a binary distribution and it needs to be compiled, some
packets are required in both cases (coders and anonymous).

The requiered packages are:
bash
wget
gcc
make
libsdl1.2-dev

The first four packets are installed by default.
For the moment the only supported Operating System in the instalation is GNU/Linux.
This is because the installer script was made in bash and the distributed PR and
makeindex are binary files. If you want to install FP in any other operating system
please download a PR distribution, compile it for your OS and replace PR file in
FP/data/bin. Then compile FP/data/bin/src/makeindex.c to FP/data/bin/makeindex.
The installation script was made and tested with bash, try to have this installed
in your system too.

If you are using debian you can install the packages just typing:
apt-get install bash wget gcc make libsdl1.2-dev

Make options:
- make            compiles only the latest modified sources
- make build      compiles all the sources
- make install    downloads dat files, generate index and compiles the game
- make clean      clears the intermediate and final compiled files
- make download   downloads the dat files, generate index
- make all        generates index and re-builds the source
- make index      generate index only

CVS nightly tarballs:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Is just the last CVS stuff compressed. To install it just uncompress it and follow
the CVS installation steps (except for the cvs command).

To install from the binary distribution files:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
There isn't any distribution yet :(

Note:
~~~~
The program is very unestable, don't expect to see the original game, because we
need a lot of time more to reach something similar. Please be patient. Current
CVS distributions are just for developers or to show the improvements.
