To make the game for the first time type:

cd FP/src
make install

index will be generated and the source compiled.

Make options:
- make            compiles only the latest modified sources
- make build      compiles all the sources
- make install    downloads dat files, generate index and compiles the game
- make clean      clears the intermediate and final compiled files
- make download   downloads the dat files, generate index
- make all        generates index and re-builds the source
- make index      generate index only
