To install from the CVS (advanced users only):
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If you are a coder type:

export CVS_RSH=ssh
cvs -z3 -d:ext:(USER)@cvs.fp.princed.com.ar:/cvsroot/freeprince co FP

If you aren't just type:

cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.fp.princed.com.ar:/cvsroot/freeprince co FP

When the download is finished, you'll get the whole repository.
To make the game for the first time type:

cd FP/src
make install

The dat files will be downloaded (about 200kb), after that the resource
configuration will be generated and the source compiled.

The CVS code isn't a binary distribution and it needs to be compiled,
some packets are required in both cases (coders and anonymous).

The requiered packages are:
 bash bzip2 sed awk wget gcc make libsdl1.2-dev

The first five packets are installed by default.
For the moment the only supported platform is x86. This is because of the
endian registers in the processors. We are working to finish porting the
abstraction disk library.
he installation script was made and tested with bash, try to have this installed
in your system.

If you are using debian you can install the packages just typing:
apt-get install bash wget gcc make libsdl1.2-dev

Make options:
- make            compiles only the latest modified sources
- make build      compiles all the sources
- make install    downloads dat files, generate index and compiles the game
- make clean      clears the intermediate and final compiled files
- make download   downloads the dat files, generate index
- make all        generates index and re-builds the source

CVS nightly tarballs:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Is just the last CVS stuff compressed. To install it just uncompress it and follow
the CVS installation steps (except for the cvs command).

To install from the binary distribution files:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
There isn't any distribution yet :(

Note:
~~~~
The program is very unestable, don't expect to see the original game, because we
need a lot of time more to reach something similar. Please be patient. Current
CVS distributions are just for developers or to show the improvements.
